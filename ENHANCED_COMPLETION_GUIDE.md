# QB64PE Enhanced Auto-Completion Testing Guide

This extension now provides comprehensive auto-completion for user-defined symbols including:

## Features Added

### 1. Symbol Parser

- **Comprehensive parsing** of QB64PE files for SUBs, FUNCTIONs, TYPEs, variables, and constants
- **Scope awareness** (LOCAL, MODULE, GLOBAL)
- **Include file support** for `$INCLUDE` statements
- **Parameter information** with type hints
- **Documentation extraction** from comments above declarations

### 2. Enhanced Completion

- **User-defined symbols** appear in completion lists with higher priority than built-in keywords
- **Scope-based filtering** - only shows symbols available in current context
- **Parameter snippets** for SUBs and FUNCTIONs with tab-through parameters
- **Type information** and documentation in hover tooltips
- **File location** information for symbols from other files

### 3. Context-Aware Inline Completion

- **Smart suggestions** based on available user symbols
- **Pattern completion** for common QB64PE idioms
- **Variable assignment** suggestions based on declared variables
- **Function call** completion with parameter placeholders

## Testing the Features

### Test Files Created:

1. `test_enhanced_completion.bas` - Main test file with various symbol types
2. `mathutils.bi` - Include file with math functions and types
3. `test_include_completion.bas` - Tests include file symbol completion

### How to Test:

1. **Open any of the test files**
2. **Type partial symbol names** and press Ctrl+Space to see completions
3. **Try typing common patterns** like:

   - `Dis` (should suggest `Distance` function from include)
   - `Add` (should suggest `AddScore` function)
   - `Play` (should suggest `PlayerType` and `players` variable)
   - `MAX` (should suggest `MAX_PLAYERS` constant)

4. **Test scope awareness**:

   - Inside SUBs/FUNCTIONs, local variables should appear first
   - Module-level symbols should be available throughout the file
   - Include file symbols should be available after `$INCLUDE`

5. **Test inline completion**:
   - Type on empty lines to see context-aware suggestions
   - Try typing `=` to see variable assignment suggestions
   - Type partial function names to see parameter completion

### Symbol Types Supported:

- **SUB** procedures with parameter completion
- **FUNCTION** with return types and parameter completion
- **TYPE** user-defined types
- **VARIABLE** (DIM, STATIC, COMMON) with scope and type info
- **CONST** constants with values
- **Array variables** with array indicator
- **SHARED variables** with shared indicator

### Scope Rules:

- **LOCAL**: Variables/parameters inside SUBs/FUNCTIONs only available within that scope
- **MODULE**: Symbols available throughout the current file
- **GLOBAL**: SHARED variables available across all files
- **INCLUDE**: Symbols from included files available after include statement

The enhanced completion system provides intelligent, context-aware suggestions that significantly improve the QB64PE development experience!
