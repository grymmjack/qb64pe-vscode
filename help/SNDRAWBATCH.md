## [_SNDRAWBATCH](SNDRAWBATCH.md) [ðŸ“–](https://qb64phoenix.com/qb64wiki/index.php/_SNDRAWBATCH)
---
<blockquote>

### The _SNDRAWBATCH statement plays a batch of sound wave sample frequencies created by a program.

</blockquote>

#### SYNTAX

<blockquote>

`_SNDRAWBATCH sampleFrameArray!([index&]) [, channels& ][, pipeHandle& ][, frameCount& ]`

</blockquote>

#### PARAMETERS

<blockquote>


* sampleFrameArray!([index&]) is an array of [SINGLE](SINGLE.md) values representing the audio sample frames. Optionally, an index can be specified to determine the starting point in the array.
* channels& is number of channels. This can be 1 (mono) or 2 (stereo). It is assumed as mono if not provided.
* pipeHandle& is a handle to the sound pipe, obtained by using the _SNDOPENRAW function.
* frameCount& is the number of sample frames to play, not the number of array elements. Each frame corresponds to one set of samples per channel.
</blockquote>

#### DESCRIPTION

<blockquote>


* Unlike _SNDRAW , _SNDRAWBATCH is designed to play a batch of sample frames. This removes the need to call the underlying audio subsystem for each sample frame and thus improves performance.
* A sample frame is one snapshot of audio data that includes the sound levels for all channels at a specific point in time. In mono audio (1 channel), a sample frame is just 1 value. In stereo audio (2 channels), a sample frame has 2 values: one for the left channel and one for the right channel.
* Stereo audio data should always be interleaved (a left channel sample followed by a right channel sample).
* Ensure that _SNDRAWLEN is comfortably above 0 (until you've finished playing sound). If you get occasional unintended random clicks, this generally means that _SNDRAWLEN has dropped to 0.
* _SNDRAWBATCH is not intended to queue up many minutes worth of sound. It will probably work but will chew up a lot of memory (and if it gets swapped to disk, your sound could be interrupted abruptly).
* _SNDRATE determines how many samples are played per second. However, the timing is done by the sound card, not your program.
* Do not attempt to use _TIMER or _DELAY or _LIMIT to control the timing of _SNDRAW. You may use them for delays or to limit your program's CPU usage, but how much to queue should only be based on the _SNDRAWLEN .

```vb
OPTION _EXPLICIT

REDIM soundBuffer(0) AS SINGLE
DIM AS LONG oct, octave, note
DIM fq AS SINGLE, noteStr AS STRING

   FOR note = 0 TO 11 'notes C to B
       fq = FreQ(octave, note, noteStr)
       PRINT USING "#####.## \\"; fq, noteStr

   noteStr = MID$("C C#D D#E F F#G G#A A#B ", note * 2 + 1, 2)
END FUNCTION
